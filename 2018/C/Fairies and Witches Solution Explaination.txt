A Polygon is Possible if 
Sum of all sides> 2*Maxium side

and Polygon should have more than 2 sides

We use simple DFS where we chose a vertice, mark it,
then chose a next vertice, which lies ahead of the first one, and is connected to first, then mark that vertice too, and chose the edge between them

Every time we goo deeper into recursion to find the next vertice, we start with the one next vertice of the first one and not transverse or chose the marked vertices.

We unmark them accordingly every time
